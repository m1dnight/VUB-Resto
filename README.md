VUB Restaurant
==============

A beautiful and easy way to view the menu of the VUB restaurant (Vrije Universiteit Brussel).

Get it: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.tjs.vubrestaurant](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.tjs.vubrestaurant)

Details
=======

The app downloads the official webpage for the restaurant (https://my.vub.ac.be/resto/etterbeek). It then parses the page, and displays the results in a CardView, grouped per day.


TODO:
======

* Clean-up code base
* Add restaurant "Jette"
* Persist the downloaded restaurant information
* Add price information in the cards (e.g., like Google Now does it?)
* Add localization: French
