Details
=======

Since 1.4 the app relies on the JSONs hosted on the InfoGroep servers to retrieve the menus.


See tomjaspers/vubresto-server for the code responsible for parsing all menus.

TODO:
======

* Persist the downloaded restaurant information
* Add price information in the cards (e.g., like Google Now does it?)


CHANGES
========

This repository is a fork of the original one by Tom Jaspers. The changes made are listed below.

* Update server endpoint because previous one is offline.
